        Things to say
            What do you think the next step is
            How would you solve this problem with a pen and paper?
            Let‘s get something working
            Tell me what you think our objective is
            Where do you think we are up to?
            What is the simplist test we could write?

            Approaching a kata: 1. Describe in own words, 2. Look to simplify, 3. Define inputs and outputs, 4. Write the steps you’d take on paper in human language with inputs and outputs
